Path forward:

1.  Parse documents as json or as text files.  grab each of them, give it an id, and stick it in database with entered = false.
2.  Parse questions in my own format.  construct maps for the frontend and for the database entry from questions. 
3.  those too things need to be a cli, like BINARY - setup that also calls a database migration.  (maybe this can be in an ansible thing or something?)
4.  then after setup ...

ODE TO NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE.





I.

'Tis done—but yesterday a King!
﻿And armed with Kings to strive—
And now thou art a nameless thing:
﻿So abject—yet alive!
Is this the man of thousand thrones,
Who strewed our earth with hostile bones,
﻿And can he thus survive?[4]
Since he, miscalled the Morning Star,[5]
Nor man nor fiend hath fallen so far.


II.[6]

Ill-minded man! why scourge thy kind
﻿Who bowed so low the knee?
By gazing on thyself grown blind,
﻿Thou taught'st the rest to see.
With might unquestioned,—power to save,—
Thine only gift hath been the grave
﻿To those that worshipped thee;
Nor till thy fall could mortals guess
Ambition's less than littleness!



III.

Thanks for that lesson—it will teach
﻿To after-warriors more
Than high Philosophy can preach,
﻿And vainly preached before.
That spell upon the minds of men[7]
Breaks never to unite again,
﻿That led them to adore
Those Pagod things of sabre-sway,
With fronts of brass, and feet of clay.



IV.

The triumph, and the vanity,
﻿The rapture of the strife—[8]
The earth quake-voice of Victory,
﻿To thee the breath of life;
The sword, the sceptre, and that sway
Which man seemed made but to obey,
﻿Wherewith renown was rife—
All quelled!—Dark Spirit! what must be
The madness of thy memory!



V.[9]

The Desolator desolate![10]
﻿The Victor overthrown!
The Arbiter of others' fate
﻿A Suppliant for his own!
Is it some yet imperial hope
That with such change can calmly cope?
﻿Or dread of death alone?
To die a Prince—or live a slave—
Thy choice is most ignobly brave!



VI.

He who of old would rend the oak,
﻿Dreamed not of the rebound;[11]
Chained by the trunk he vainly broke—
﻿Alone—how looked he round?
Thou, in the sternness of thy strength,
An equal deed hast done at length,
﻿And darker fate hast found:
He fell, the forest prowlers' prey;
But thou must eat thy heart away!



VII.

The Roman,[12] when his burning heart
﻿Was slaked with blood of Rome,
Threw down the dagger—dared depart,
﻿In savage grandeur, home.—
He dared depart in utter scorn
Of men that such a yoke had borne,
﻿Yet left him such a doom!
His only glory was that hour
Of self-upheld abandoned power.



VIII.

The Spaniard, when the lust of sway
﻿Had lost its quickening spell,[13]
Cast crowns for rosaries away,
﻿An empire for a cell;
A Strict accountant of his beads,
A subtle disputant on creeds,
﻿His dotage trifled well:[14]
Yet better had he neither known
A bigot's shrine, nor despot's throne.



IX.

But thou—from thy reluctant hand
﻿The thunderbolt is wrung—
Too late thou leav'st the high command
﻿To which thy weakness clung;
All Evil Spirit as thou art,
It is enough to grieve the heart
﻿To see thine own unstrung;
To think that God's fair world hath been
The footstool of a thing so mean;



X.

And Earth hath spilt her blood for him,
﻿Who thus can hoard his own!
And Monarchs bowed the trembling limb,
﻿And thanked him for a throne!
Fair Freedom! we may hold thee dear,
When thus thy mightiest foes their fear
﻿In humblest guise have shown.
Oh! ne'er may tyrant leave behind
A brighter name to lure mankind!


XI.

Thine evil deeds are writ in gore,
﻿Nor written thus in vain—
Thy triumphs tell of fame no more,
﻿Or deepen every stain:
If thou hadst died as Honour dies,
Some new Napoleon might arise,
﻿To shame the world again—
But who would soar the solar height,
To set in such a starless night?[15]



XII.

Weigh'd in the balance, hero dust
﻿Is vile as vulgar clay;[16]
Thy scales, Mortality! are just
﻿To all that pass away:
But yet methought the living great
Some higher sparks should animate,
﻿To dazzle and dismay:
Nor deem'd Contempt could thus make mirth
Of these, the Conquerors of the earth.



XIII.[17]

And she, proud Austria's mournful flower,
﻿Thy still imperial bride;
How bears her breast the torturing hour?
﻿Still clings she to thy side?
Must she too bend, must she too share
Thy late repentance, long despair,
﻿Thou throneless Homicide?
If still she loves thee, hoard that gem,—
'Tis worth thy vanished diadem![18]



XIV.

Then haste thee to thy sullen Isle,
﻿And gaze upon the sea;[19]
That element may meet thy smile—
﻿It ne'er was ruled by thee!
Or trace with thine all idle hand[20]
In loitering mood upon the sand
﻿That Earth is now as free!
That Corinth's pedagogue[21] hath now
Transferred his by-word to thy brow.


XV.

Thou Timour! in his captive's cage[22][23]
﻿What thoughts will there be thine,
While brooding in thy prisoned rage?
﻿But one—"The world was mine!"
Unless, like he of Babylon,[24]
All sense is with thy sceptre gone,[25]
﻿Life will not long confine
That spirit poured so widely forth—
So long obeyed—so little worth!



XVI.

Or, like the thief of fire from heaven,[26]
﻿Wilt thou withstand the shock?
And share with him, the unforgiven,
﻿His vulture and his rock!
Foredoomed by God—by man accurst,[27]
And that last act, though not thy worst,
﻿The very Fiend's arch mock;[28]
He in his fall preserved his pride,
And, if a mortal, had as proudly died![29][30]



XVII.

There was a day—there was an hour,
﻿While earth was Gaul's—Gaul thine—[31]
When that immeasurable power
﻿Unsated to resign
Had been an act of purer fame
Than gathers round Marengo's name
﻿And gilded thy decline,
Through the long twilight of all time,
Despite some passing clouds of crime.


XVIII.

But thou forsooth must be a King
﻿And don the purple vest,
As if that foolish robe could wring
﻿Remembrance from thy breast.
Where is that faded garment? where[32]
The gewgaws thou wert fond to wear,
﻿The star, the string, the crest?[33][34]
Vain froward child of Empire! say,
Are all thy playthings snatched away?



XIX.

Where may the wearied eye repose[35]
﻿When gazing on the Great;
Where neither guilty glory glows,
﻿Nor despicable state?
Yes—One—the first—the last—the best—
The Cincinnatus of the West,
﻿Whom Envy dared not hate,
Bequeathed the name of Washington,
To make man blush there was but one!
